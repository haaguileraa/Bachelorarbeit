I wish to express my sincere thanks to Prof. Dr. Nicolas Joly
at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Light. I acknowledge that his supervision, guidance, and experience played an influential role throughout the development of this project. His previous work and advice represented a fundamental pillar and steered me in the right direction while writing the code.

Further, I express my gratitude to Prof. Dr.-Ing. Bernhard Schmauss of the Department of high-frequency technology at the FAU, firstly, for allowing me to work with him at the department, and secondly, for his assistance.  

Finally,  I acknowledge my friends and family for their unfailing support through the process of researching, coding, and writing. Thank you all.
