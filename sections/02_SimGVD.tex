\chapter{Modeling of the Group Velocity Dispersion}

First will be the fiber treated as a linear optical medium while considering the pulse-propagation problem, thus it is possible to inspect the effect of GVD under certain circumstances where it dominates over the nonlinearities \citep{ AgrawalBook}. A further objective of this chapter is to implement a code capable of illustrate the Dispersion-induced broadening of optical pulses for Gaussian and "sech" shapes.
