    \section{Modeling the short  pulse propagation}
    In order to have an easier understanding of the physical processes that are involved in the propagation of short pulses in a medium, it will be first necessary to focus on the dispersion that affects this medium. The purpose of this chapter is to consider the fiber as a linear optical medium while studying the pulse-propagation problem, thus, it is possible to inspect the effect of GVD under certain circumstances where it dominates over the nonlinearities \citep{ AgrawalBook}. A further objective of this chapter is to implement a code capable of illustrate the Dispersion-induced broadening of optical pulses for both Gaussian and Hyperbolic-Secant (Sech) shapes.
