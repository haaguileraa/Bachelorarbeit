\section{Running the code}
\label{sec:initvariables}
It is necessary to install all the packages and download the elements of this project to run the code. One can find the required files on Github\footnote{\url{https://github.com/haaguileraa/NLSE}}, there is possible to either clone the repository or download the files on a ZIP file. The code was written using Python 3, install this programming language on the machine is therefore mandatory. 

Firstly, we should upgrade pip using:
\ \\

\begin{lstlisting}
python -m pip install --upgrade pip .
\end{lstlisting}

The next step is to install the packages by using the command line:
\ \\

\begin{lstlisting}
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt . 
\end{lstlisting}


After following this process, the computer should fulfill the prerequisites to run the file "index.py." Consequently, the Dash app for GVD is available (by default) using the desired web browser and opening the link \url{http://127.0.0.1:8050/apps/gvd}. One can access the SPM and NLSE apps by clicking the links on each layout, as well as by changing the path from "apps/gvd" to "apps/spm" and "apps/nlse" consecutively.

However, it is also possible to run the code using Matplotlib utilizing the file "prop\_matplot.py." Consequently, the user can change the parameters manually directly into the code; nevertheless, its use requires a higher level of expertise using Python.
